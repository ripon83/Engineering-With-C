**Author: Dr. Ripon Patgiri**

## Chapter 5: The Loops

This chapter focuses on loops such as while, do-while and for loops. We also introduce time complexity. A reader can easily find the time complexity of a loop. 

### Video tutorials in YouTube link: [Engineering with C](https://www.youtube.com/@dr.patgiri) 
I describe all the programs in the Youtube link. Currently, the YouTube channel is **under construction**.

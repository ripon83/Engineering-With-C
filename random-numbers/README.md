## Chapter 10: The Random Numbers

This chapter focuses on random number generator. The random number generator is classified into two key categories: pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) and true-random number generator (TRNG).

## List of programs

The source codes are made for PRNG and TRNG. We generate various-sized random number as follows-
- 16-bit random number
- 32-bit random number
- 64-bit random number

Moreover, we use address, clock(), and hash function to generate the random numbers. Therefore, the address is denoted as 'a', clock() or __tdsc() is denoted as 'c' and hash function is denoted as 'h' in the function names.

**Author: Dr. Ripon Patgiri**

## Chapter 13: The Multidimensional Array 

This chapter focuses more on two-dimensional array (matrix). The matrix is the most used array. For instance,
the image, sound, video, etc., can be represented in matrix or 2D array format.

I describe all the programs in the Youtube link. Currently, the YouTube channel is **under construction**.

## List of programs

**Most of the problems have two solutions**:
	- Solution with convnetional two-dimensional representation. For instance, mat[5][10]
	- Solution with one-dimensional representation for the matrix. It requires conversion of one-dimensional to two-dimensional representation. We demonstrates hot to represent the 2D array (matrix) using a single dimensional array. 

You can learn and master how to solve problems of matrix. Also, it will help in **job interviews** like campus placements.  Therefore, this chapter contains the following programs:
1. Matrix as a paramater of a function
2. Display a matrix
3. Add, subtract and multiply two matrices
4. Transpose a matrix
6. Sparse matrix
5. Fold a matrix
	- Fold left triangular matrix
	- Fold right triangular matrix
	- Fold horizontally
	- Fold vertically
6. Flip a matrix
	- Flip the matrix horizontally
	- Flip the matrix vertically
7. Rotate a matrix
	- Rotate a matrix clockwise direction
	- Rotate a matrix counterclockwise direction
8. Prints diagonal elements
	- Prints principal diagonal elements
	- Prints secondary principal diagonal elements
9. Print triangular matrices.
   	- Left-upper triangular matrix
   	- Left-lower triangular matrix 
	- Right-upper triangular matrix 
	- Right-lower triangular matrix
10. Idemptotent matrix
11. Maximum and minimum in a matrix
	- Maximum and minimum of each row
	- Maximum and minimum of each column
12. Summation of a matrix
	- Summation of each row
	- Summation of each column
13. Diagonal elements in zig-zag order
14. Display a matrix spirally
15. Minesweeper hints generation
16. Sudoku solution validator
17. Bit matrix: An efficient matrix that stores zeros and ones and reduces the memory requirements.
18. Basic matrix encryption and decryption.
